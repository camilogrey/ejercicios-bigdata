## The PROMPTS.md File

Just like the Final Project, the most important thing is to document **your real prompts**.

### Template

```markdown
# PROMPTS - Streaming and Cloud

**Student:** [Your name]
**Date:** [Submission date]
**Modules completed:** [08 / 09 / both]

---

## Part 1: My Prompts (EXACTLY as I wrote them)

### Challenge 1: Launch Kafka
[Paste your real prompt, with errors and all]

**AI Response:**
[Summary of what it answered]

**Result:**
- [ ] Worked on the first try
- [ ] Had to adjust (explain what)
- [ ] Did not work (explain the error)

### Challenge 2: Producer
[...]

### Challenge 3: Consumer
[...]

(continue with each challenge you completed)

---

## Part 2: Screenshots

Include screenshots of:
- Kafka UI showing messages (if you did 08)
- Alerts in console (if you did 08)
- Successful `terraform apply` (if you did 09)
- S3 bucket with data (if you did 09)

---

## Part 3: Reflection

### What I learned about streaming/cloud
[2-3 paragraphs]

### Difference between batch and streaming
[Your understanding]

### What I would do differently
[Self-criticism]

---

## Part 4: Blueprint (generated by AI)

Ask your AI:
> "Summarize in professional format the previous prompts,
> highlighting learning patterns and progression"

[Paste the response here]
```

## How to Submit

### Step 1: Create your folder

```bash
# From the root of your fork
mkdir -p entregas/streaming_cloud/your_lastname_firstname
```

### Step 2: Copy your files

```bash
# If you did Kafka
mkdir -p entregas/streaming_cloud/your_lastname_firstname/kafka
cp docker-compose.yml productor.py consumidor.py entregas/.../kafka/

# If you did LocalStack
mkdir -p entregas/streaming_cloud/your_lastname_firstname/localstack
cp -r *.tf lambdas/ entregas/.../localstack/
```

### Step 3: Create PROMPTS.md

Use the template above and document your entire process.

### Step 4: Upload

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Streaming/Cloud Submission - Lastname Firstname"
git push
```

## Reference Examples

Reference dashboards are available for inspiration:

- [Global Seismic Observatory](../dashboards/dashboard_sismos_global.md) - Earthquake visualization example
- [ISS Tracker](../dashboards/dashboard_iss_tracker.md) - Space tracker example

!!! warning "Do not copy"
    These are the professor's examples. Your dashboard should have your own style.
    The system detects excessive similarity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it mandatory?

No. These modules are **bonus** for those who want to go deeper.

### Can I do only one?

Yes. You can submit only Kafka (08) or only LocalStack (09).

### How does it affect my grade?

Completing correctly = **bonus** on top of your Final Project grade.

### Do I need Spark for module 08?

The Spark Streaming challenge is advanced. You can do challenges 1-5 without Spark.

### Is LocalStack the same as real AWS?

The code is identical. The difference is that LocalStack runs on your machine
at no cost. If your code works on LocalStack, it works on AWS.
